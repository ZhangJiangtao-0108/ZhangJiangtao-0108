- ðŸ”­ I'm **ZhangJiangtao**.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on my PhD at Hefei University of Technology.
- ðŸ‘¯ My major research focuses on multimodal sign language recognition and translation.

I have open sourced a sensor modality-based (sEMG and IMU) sign language gesture data processing library [DataPreProcess_packages](https://github.com/ZhangJiangtao-0108/DataPreProcess_packages), which allows users to easily process sEMG and IMU data.

In addition, I have open-sourced partal sign language recognition database [OH-Sentence](https://github.com/ZhangJiangtao-0108/OH-Sentence_Dataset) based on sensor (**sEMG & IMU**) and [MM-Sentence](https://github.com/ZhangJiangtao-0108/MM-Sentence_Dataset) based visal (**RGB & Skeletal**) and sensor (**sEMG & IMU**). If you are a sign language related researcher and need to use our database, please contact me (zhangjiangtao@mail.hfut.edu.cn).
